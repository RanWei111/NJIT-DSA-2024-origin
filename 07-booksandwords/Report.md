## Question 1. What is your hash function like for hash table solution (if you implemented hash table) ï¼š

## Question 2. For binary search trees (if you implemented it), how does your implementation get the top-100 list? :


## Question 3. What can you say about the correctness of your implementation? Any issues, bugs or problems you couldn't solve? Any idea why the problem persists and what could perhaps be the solution? :



## Question 4. What can you say about the time complexity of your implementation? How efficient is the code in reading and managing the words and their counts? How efficient is your code in getting the top-100 list? Which sorting algorithm are you using? What is the time complexity of that algorithm? :



## Question 5. What did you find the most difficult things to understand and implement in this programming task? Why?:


## Question 6. What did you learn doing this? :
